# Finance_Manager
A basic finance calculator built using C#

When running the program the user will be prompted to enter their name and monthly salary.
The user will then be redirected to a page where they can enter their monthtly expenses using the menu buttons at the top of the page. 

After entering an expense the text field on the right of the page will echo the user's input back to them.
The option to calculate the income surplus after expenses is also available from the menu at the top of the page.
When entering a property expense (renting or buying a property) each of the two options is available under the Property Expenses section.

NOTE: when entering interest rates please enter actual rate as an integer and not as a decimal,
the program will do the conversion for calculations automatically. 
NOTE: the class library has been included as a seperate folder in case it needs to be 
manually reloaded to the program 
NOTE: the pictures on the frmFinances form may need to be manually added to the project
when it is opened on a new machine. If this is the case they can be found in the folder
named "images". Please add them to the ImageView component on the frmFinances page.
